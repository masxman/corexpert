Chapter 3: PROJECT SUBJECT

3.1 Introduction
AI Career Coach is a structured career development platform that guides users through a sequential process of profile creation, market analysis, and professional tool generation. The application uses AI to create a personalized experience where users first provide information about their professional background, then receive tailored market insights, and finally access tools for resume building, cover letter generation, and interview preparation. Each step builds upon the previous, creating a comprehensive career development journey that addresses the specific needs of individual users based on their industry, role, and experience level.

3.2 About System
The AI Career Coach system follows a user-centered workflow that starts with authentication and profile creation. After logging in, users complete an onboarding process that captures their profession, industry, experience level, and background information. This profile data serves as the foundation for all subsequent interactions with the system.

The system architecture includes:
• Authentication layer using Clerk for secure user management
• User profile database storing professional background information
• AI integration with Google's Gemini API for personalized content generation
• Interactive tools for document creation and interview practice
• Market insights module that pulls industry-specific data

The application guides users through a logical progression:
1. Profile creation → 2. Market insights → 3. Resume building → 4. Cover letter generation → 5. Interview preparation

3.3 Problem Statement
The AI Career Coach addresses specific challenges in the modern job search and career development process:

1. Fragmented Career Tools: Job seekers typically need to use multiple disconnected platforms for market research, resume building, and interview preparation. This system unifies these tools in a single, coherent workflow.

2. Generic Career Advice: Most career resources provide generalized guidance that doesn't account for industry-specific requirements. The application delivers personalized insights based on the user's specific professional background.

3. Resume Optimization: Many qualified candidates are rejected because their resumes aren't optimized for applicant tracking systems. The platform provides AI-powered resume analysis and improvement suggestions.

4. Interview Readiness: Job seekers often struggle to prepare effectively for interviews in their specific field. The system generates relevant industry and role-specific questions with targeted feedback.

5. Time-Consuming Job Application Process: Creating tailored materials for each application is time-intensive. The AI-powered cover letter generator streamlines this process while maintaining personalization.
